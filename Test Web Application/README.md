# Test Web Application


This was written using NodeJS, Express, and Body-Parser. They should all be included in the package.json, but if not, those will need to be installed for this to run successfully.

During the coding of this test server, I tested using the RESTClient Extension for Mozilla Firefox (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/restclient/).
